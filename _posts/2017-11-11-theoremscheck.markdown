My Rails application will essentially allow you, nerd like me, to keep track of all the scientists and theorems that you love and want to remember. You'll find quotes, corollaries and much more with a nice responsive layout that also satisfies the eye.
I gotta admit that it took quite some time to find the right idea. I wanted as always to be something that could tell a little bit about me and maybe be also useful in my everyday life!
Through a nested form you'll be able to create a new scientist along with a new theorem, select its subject and area or create a new one.
The user will also be able to create theorems both as a nested resource (inside its scientist) and as a regular resource through a form, that will still allow the creation of a new area in case of need.
A list of quotes will be available as long as a page to get random quotes, with a button to save them among your favorites.
Sign in is available through regular form or facebook and github, using the related omniauth gems.
Here's a link to my [repo](https://github.com/gnappo1/TheoremsCheck), go check it out!
