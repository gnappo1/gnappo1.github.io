Many thoughts, many ideas... All of them lead to really ambitious projects, but which one will be THE ONE?
Back to the usual exhistential questions, I decided in the end to work on something that with future updates and improvements might become a useful app.
I had the idea about this project walking through the hall of the condo where I live. Why not be useful to older people, busy parents or just lazy folks and help them out with their daily food shopping? Why not build something that might make the whole process smoother and a little more technological than the old pensil and pen?
This was my starting point and the results I reached, are promising for future actual uses.
The user will be able to signup/login as a Client or as a Shopper:

Once logged in the personal account, a navbar will guide the user through the different pages:

1. Clients - shows the list of all clients with links to their personal page.
2. Shoppers -  shows the list of all shoppers with links to their personal page.
3. Profile Page - shows the personal page of the user and contains links to all his lists. Contains information about how to contact the user and his private shopper if the user is a Client, or his clients in case of a Shopper.
4. Lists - shows the links to all the lists related to the user.
5. Edit Profile - allows the user to edit details about his Personal Profile.
6. Delete Profile - allows the user to delete his Personal Profile.
7. Logout - allows the user to logout his account.
